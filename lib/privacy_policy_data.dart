# Privacy Policy
**Last Updated: 29-12-2025**

ZenithSyntax ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in the BlindKey mobile application ("App").

Unlike traditional cloud-based apps, BlindKey is a local-first utility. This means your private files and encryption keys stay where they belong: on your device.

## 1. Information We Do Not Collect
Because BlindKey operates locally, we do not collect, store, or have access to:

*   **Your Files:** Any files, images, videos, or documents you encrypt are processed locally on your device.
*   **Your Passwords/Keys:** We do not transmit or store your encryption passwords or "Master Keys." If you lose them, we cannot recover them.
*   **Your Decrypted Data:** We never see the content of your .blindkey files.

## 2. Information We May Collect
To improve the App experience and maintain functionality, we may collect limited information in the following categories:

### A. Technical and Usage Data
We may use third-party analytics tools (such as Google Analytics for Firebase) to collect non-identifiable information, including:
*   Device model and operating system version.
*   App crashes and performance logs.
*   Frequency of App usage and feature engagement.

### B. Connection Data
To validate the expiry dates of shared .blindkey files, the App may ping a global time server. This process does not involve sending your personal files to the server; it only synchronizes the date and time to prevent local clock manipulation.

### C. Third-Party Advertisements
If the App displays advertisements, our third-party ad partners (e.g., Google AdMob) may collect:
*   Your device’s advertising ID.
*   General location data (IP address).
*   Interaction data with the ads shown.

## 3. Data Storage and Security
*   **Local Storage:** All Content is stored in the App’s private directory on your device or in the location you choose during export.
*   **Encryption:** We use industry-standard encryption protocols to secure your files. However, the security of your data ultimately depends on the strength of the password you choose and the physical security of your mobile device.

## 4. Sharing of Information
We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. We only share information in the following limited circumstances:
*   **Service Providers:** With third-party vendors who provide crash reporting or advertising services.
*   **Legal Requirements:** If required by law, we may disclose information to authorities, though we remind users that we do not have access to your encrypted content.

## 5. Permissions
The App may request certain permissions to function correctly, such as:
*   **Storage/Files:** To select files for encryption and save encrypted .blindkey files.
*   **Internet Access:** To verify file expiry and load advertisements.

## 6. Children’s Privacy
BlindKey does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age in your jurisdiction). If you are a parent and believe your child has provided us with information, please contact us.

## 7. Changes to This Policy
ZenithSyntax reserves the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. We will notify users of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page.
